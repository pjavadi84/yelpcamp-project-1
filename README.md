My actual yelpcamp project

This is a very simply yelpcamp project where users can post pictures of their favorite camp sites with pictures and description about their experience.
The app lets actual user edit his/her post contents, as well as other users who made comment about the post. Only one user has a comment belong to his/her 
comments and cannot modify or delete other posts that he/she does not have ownership of to authenticate user.
